# Savor

**Project Description**

A full stack MERN application that returns recipes based on a user’s grocery list. As users consume their groceries and remove food from their grocery list, a list of recipes dynamically changes, allowing the user to make the most of the food they have, thus reducing waste. The app utilizes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, CSS3, Boostrap, Passport, Bcrypt, the Edamam API and Heroku. 


**Instructions**

1.	*Create a grocery list by entering grocery items and hitting the **Submit** button.*
